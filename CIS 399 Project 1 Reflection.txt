Project 1 Reflection.

I have never had any contact with any kind of system administration before signing up for this class.
As such this initial project was very informative to me. I learned that an operating system can be installed onto
an empty computer easily and quickly. I also learned that the operating system includes standard basic software applications
such as Mozilla Firefox and programs with functionality comparable to Microsoft Office, Power Point, and Excel.

Our installation document follows our installation process every step of the way. The final version includes what we did, in what order
we did it, and it also includes a listing of the features that were included in the installed product.
